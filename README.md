# GOPH 420 Lab 04

Python code that performs linear least squares regression. This code provides information that explores the Gutenberg-Richter law.

This lab goes into the nature of seismic activity at an industrial site involving fluid injection into a shale formation. This is done through using the Gutenberg-Richter law to analyze earthquake frequency relationships. 

The main code is driver.py this is where the code should be run. This file uses the functions in the gutenberg_richter.py and regression.py file.

Steps to run Code: Clone repository 1.) git clone https://github.com/MudkipTheGr8/goph420-w2025-lab04-stMD Create a virtural environment 2.) python -m venv nenv Install packages 3.) python -m pip install -r requirements.txt Run Main Script 4.) python driver.py
